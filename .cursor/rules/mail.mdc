- **Utilize the Resend API** for all email sending functionalities (e.g., via the `resend` client).
- **Store email templates** in the `/templates` directory and load them dynamically in the code.
- **Implement error handling** for Resend API calls to manage failures gracefully (e.g., try/catch blocks).
- **Securely manage Resend API keys** using environment variablesâ€”never hardcode them.
- **Adhere to email best practices** to ensure deliverability and avoid spam filters (e.g., clear subject lines, opt-out links).
- **Include logging** for email sending operations to track successes and failures for debugging.
